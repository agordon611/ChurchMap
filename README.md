# Welcome to Church Map

My dad asked me to create this webapp as a project for our parish at home. 
This webapp contains 2 screens: a map and a guest sign in form. When a user
fills out the guest sign-in form, their info is sent to a Firebase database. 
Also, when the user submits the form, a backend API call helps determine the
latitude and longitude of the hometown the user submitted. This latitude and
longitude is important for the map page. The map page displays a map of the 
United States with markers located at every hometown a guest resides.
